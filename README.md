# lunchbot for Slack
We can never decide where to eat for lunch, so this bot will tell us what to do. Or at least make a suggestion. 

This bot, built for [Slack](https://slack.com/), posts its decision into a team Slack channel.

##Dependencies

Well, the big thing this requires is [Slack](https://slack.com/), which is a team communications tool we use.

This is a program written in JavaScript for [Node](http://nodejs.org/), and it uses the the Request node module.

	npm install request

Deets on how this came to be, and how to get the incoming webhook URL you need to make this work, can be found in [this blog post](http://johnkeefe.net/make-every-week-lunch-bot "Make Every Week: Lunch Bot - johnkeefe.net").
